In this project, the task was to create a simple calendar application that will allow the user to save to do events for each hour of the day. The application has been designed to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. JQuery and JavaScript are used to power the functionality of the application.

Third party API's were used for the time and date function through Moment.js.

Some key feature of this work day application are that the current day is displayed at the top of the application, time blocks are displayed for standard business hours, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether the block is in the past, present, or future. Also, each time block will open an event to allow the user to input their event and a save button to save that input into their local storage, the events will still exist after the page has been refreshed.

I hope you enjoy my application!
